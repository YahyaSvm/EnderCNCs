### Got too many Enders laying around? Dont need a [5th Trident?](https://github.com/yell3D/Ender3dent) Well! Try one of the EnderCNC's, born from a lack of sleep, a wish to learn more CAD and too many spare parts floating around.

## Current plan has changed a bit. There will be multiple versions of these.

### A [new cheaper version](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/Ender3CNC) is now released!

- Based only on the Ender 3 PRO, where every part from the printer counts to keep the BOM cost very low. This will now be the Ender3CNC.
- As of now BOM cost is ~60$ not counting the Ender 3 PRO or dremel/spindle. But chances are you have some of the BOM laying around already.
- This version will include CAD for milling its own aluminium upgrades if it can handle it like the original version.

- The [original EnderCNC](https://github.com/Futtawuh/EnderCNCs/tree/main/EnderCNC%20CAD) underwent a facelift and is tested OK on parts and is now in "release" version and wont have updates unless issues arise. (this was loosely based on the Ender 3 PRO + Ender 4 parts)

### Other versions

- The MGN version will be based around the new Ender3CNC version, with minor tweaks to the frame layout resulting in a bigger cutting area.
